# 🚀Introduction🚀
This is my first side project, a website where people share their trivia or interesting facts. There are tons of ideas in my brain, I will keep updating more functions through time while upscaling my skills in React, Tailwind, Firebase, etc.  

[Project Retrospective](https://medium.com/@johnnyfang_11536/side-project-triviagora-f8eaa4593423): I recorded the development process, e.g., my thoughts about the product, obstacles encountered during development, and what could be improved, etc. The article is in Mandarin; an English version will be available in the near future.  

This is the homepage:
